## Competition Question:
### In 1984, Richard Roll published a paper in The American Economic Review entitled “Orange Juice and Weather”. In the paper he found what he termed a "statistically significant relation between OJ returns and subsequent errors in temperature forecasts issued by the National Weather Service for the central Florida region." In other words, Professor Roll found that commodity markets add information above and beyond the information contained in weather forecasts by the National Weather Service. 

### Is it possible that futures prices tell us something about the future behavior of something that the general public really cares about (or should care about)? Take for instance crude oil prices, people generally expect (or journalists expect) that increased crude prices will reflect increased prices for gasoline at the pump. You should demonstrate whether that “expectation” is true: how good a predicter of future gasoline prices are oil futures? What is the lag? Is the response different when crude prices are falling than when they are rising? Are there additional explanatory variables?

### Now for something that the general public should care about – atmospheric carbon dioxide. Do crude prices contain predictive power for the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? Are there additional data that improve the forecast? What are the implications contained in the current forecast?
